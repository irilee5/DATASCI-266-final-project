Dutch neighbour Gertrudis Van Delf said: 'He d been saying for some time he was worried about the stability of the house because of subsidence. 'He had just retired and was planning on coming to live here all year round.'

Costa s hamstring injury meant Valencia s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes. Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9. Dream start: David Silva jumps on to Paco Alcacer's shoulders to celebrate his goal that put Spain 2-0 up against Macedonia in Valencia . Breaking away: Cesc Fabregas escapes a challenge from Macedonian midfielder Stefan Spirovski as Spain exerted their authority in the midfield areas . Easy does it: Sergio Ramos is congratulated after his cheeky chipped penalty put Spain ahead inside the Ciutat de Valencia stadium in Group C . New face: And before long Paco Alcacer was doubling the lead after a smart passing move which saw him presented with an open goal in his hometown . Muted celebration: Agim Ibraimi jogs back towards the half-way line after his penalty reduced the deficit to just one goal in the first half . Spain: Casillas; Alba, Abidol, Ramos (Bartra 68) , Juanfran; Busquets, Silva, Koke (Munir 77), Fabregas, Pedro, Alcacer (Isco 57). Scorers: Ramos 16 (pen), Alcacer 17, Busquets 45+3, Silva 50, Pedro 90+1. Booked: Koke, Fabregas. Macedonia: Pacovski, Cuculi, Sikov, Mosjsov, Alioski (Demiri 46), Trajkovski, Spirovski (Radeski 64), Ristovski, Abdurahimi (Velkoski 74), Jahovic, Ibraimi. Scorer: Ibraimi 28 (pen). Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down   the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain s success in the last European Championship. More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width. Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain s disastrous World Cup campaign. The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski. Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save . And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors  defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score. It was his 21st goal for Spain   of non-strikers only fellow midfielder Fernando Hierro has scored more. Back in the game: Ibraimi's Macedonian team-mates congratulate him after he successfully converts the spot kick conceded by Juanfran . The bosses: Vicente del Bosque was back after offering his resignation after the World Cup and came up against Macedonia boss Boshko Gjurovski on the touchline . Combative: Ramos goes in hard for this header up against Macedonia's Stefan Ristovski during an aerial clash in the first half in Valencia . Dominant: Barcelona's Pedro takes the ball away from grounded Macedonian defender Ardijan Cuculi as Spain made their opponents work . Taking control: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke, one of the newer members of Spain's starting line-up, brings the ball forward in the middle of the park . It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar   this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9. Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass. With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days.

In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\\"Amazing Spider-Man\\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\\"The Superior Spider-Man\\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it.\\\" Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic. CNN: Why did you choose Doc Ock as the next Spider-Man? Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids. One of his first lines was, \\\"Some day I'll show them all! Some day they'll be sorry they ever laughed at me.\\\" That's not something a hero would say. If Peter had never learned the lesson of \\\"great power and great responsibility,\\\" there's every chance he would have become a supervillain. And then you have Otto Octavius, a bespectacled scientist who, after his radioactive accident, became the eight-legged Doctor Octopus. For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection. So what if we flipped it? What if we gave him a second chance? Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path. But is that enough? Can that overcome Ock's true nature? CNN: How did this idea originate? Stephen Wacker: This was an idea Dan had when he came onto the book. It changed shape as we went. It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change. With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang. CNN: Did the word spread around Marvel quickly when this was first discussed? Wacker: Three times a year we have editorial retreats, where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book. Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal. There were certainly some loud opinions in the room. Our editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, was one of the louder voices not buying it originally. All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently. CNN: Was that a sneak preview of how fans might react? Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me. Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online. It gets more magnified with Spidey. You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever. I keep all the fan mail. You can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop Marvel forever. There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction. That's a part of the job I like. Slott: I've actually gotten a fair amount of \\\"This is awesome!\\\" (reactions to the story), but it's been very polarizing. No one has a middling review. No one has a take of, \\\"It was all right.\\\" People are very split. I got an angry tweet saying, \\\"I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people.\\\" I'm like, good luck reading Charles Dickens, Mark Twain -- anything in literature! Now people are saying, \\\"Nooooo! Why are you being mean to (Peter)?\\\" The answer is two words: \\\"Dra. Ma.\\\" CNN: Have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media? Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world! Everyone knows who Spider-Man is-- and everyone cares about him! In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace. But in our world, he's beloved. Now we're going to flip that too. The readers are Jonah. They aren't ready to cut this guy a break. They think he's a menace! This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all! And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Andrew McGaughey, 65, buried to his neck when ground gave way .

This incident is in contrast to past instances of Chinese vessels deliberately disrupting US naval activities. The US Navy has previously documented such incidents, including one in March where a fire hose was used to avoid a collision.\",\n          \"Cassandra Morton, a 23-year-old black woman, went missing in Lynchburg, Virginia in 2009 and her decomposed body was found on a mountain. Despite her family's efforts, her case remained unsolved for years, overshadowed by the more prominent cases of Morgan Harrington and Hannah Graham. Recently, a suspect, Jesse L. Matthew Jr., was arrested in connection with Graham's disappearance, leading authorities to re-examine Morton's case. The Campbell County Sheriff's Office is investigating any possible connection between Matthew and Morton's death.

Costa s hamstring injury meant Valencia s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes. Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9. Dream start: David Silva jumps on to Paco Alcacer's shoulders to celebrate his goal that put Spain 2-0 up against Macedonia in Valencia . Breaking away: Cesc Fabregas escapes a challenge from Macedonian midfielder Stefan Spirovski as Spain exerted their authority in the midfield areas . Easy does it: Sergio Ramos is congratulated after his cheeky chipped penalty put Spain ahead inside the Ciutat de Valencia stadium in Group C . New face: And before long Paco Alcacer was doubling the lead after a smart passing move which saw him presented with an open goal in his hometown . Muted celebration: Agim Ibraimi jogs back towards the half-way line after his penalty reduced the deficit to just one goal in the first half . Spain: Casillas; Alba, Abidol, Ramos (Bartra 68) , Juanfran; Busquets, Silva, Koke (Munir 77), Fabregas, Pedro, Alcacer (Isco 57). Scorers: Ramos 16 (pen), Alcacer 17, Busquets 45+3, Silva 50, Pedro 90+1. Booked: Koke, Fabregas. Macedonia: Pacovski, Cuculi, Sikov, Mosjsov, Alioski (Demiri 46), Trajkovski, Spirovski (Radeski 64), Ristovski, Abdurahimi (Velkoski 74), Jahovic, Ibraimi. Scorer: Ibraimi 28 (pen). Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down   the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain s success in the last European Championship. More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width. Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain s disastrous World Cup campaign. The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski. Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save . And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors  defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score. It was his 21st goal for Spain   of non-strikers only fellow midfielder Fernando Hierro has scored more. Back in the game: Ibraimi's Macedonian team-mates congratulate him after he successfully converts the spot kick conceded by Juanfran . The bosses: Vicente del Bosque was back after offering his resignation after the World Cup and came up against Macedonia boss Boshko Gjurovski on the touchline . Combative: Ramos goes in hard for this header up against Macedonia's Stefan Ristovski during an aerial clash in the first half in Valencia . Dominant: Barcelona's Pedro takes the ball away from grounded Macedonian defender Ardijan Cuculi as Spain made their opponents work . Taking control: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke, one of the newer members of Spain's starting line-up, brings the ball forward in the middle of the park . It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar   this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9. Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass. With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days. The Barcelona striker has a Spanish mother and Moroccan father and was playing in the level below Bar a s B-team last season. His cameo and the performances of Alcacer show that Spain have plenty left in the locker as they look to defend their Euro crown. What remains to be seen is how Chelsea s Costa fits into Del Bosque s brave new world. Making sure: Sergio Busquets accepts the congratulations of Fabregas after he made it 3-1 in the closing stages of the first half in Valencia . Gesture: Busquets celebrates his goal with a hand sign after putting Spain back in charge in this Group C qualifying opener for the European champions . Spanish sensation: Manchester City playmaker Silva points to the sky after his smart finish made it four for the home side in the second half . Premier League's stamp of class: Silva celebrates after he knocked the ball past the goalkeeper to make it 4-1 to Spain in Valencia . Warm embrace: Alba and Koke are the first to congratulate Silva as he boosts Spain's goal difference in what should be a straightforward qualification group . Spain's supremacy in midfield: Chelsea man Fabregas helped the home side to take control at the Ciutat de Valencia stadium against the hardworking Macedonians .\",\n          \"(CNN) -- For decades, comic books have had major shake-ups in their pages, with varying degrees of fan support -- and outrage. In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\\"Amazing Spider-Man\\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\\"The Superior Spider-Man\\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it.\\\" Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic. CNN: Why did you choose Doc Ock as the next Spider-Man? Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids. One of his first lines was, \\\"Some day I'll show them all! Some day they'll be sorry they ever laughed at me.\\\" That's not something a hero would say. If Peter had never learned the lesson of \\\"great power and great responsibility,\\\" there's every chance he would have become a supervillain. And then you have Otto Octavius, a bespectacled scientist who, after his radioactive accident, became the eight-legged Doctor Octopus. For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection. So what if we flipped it? What if we gave him a second chance? Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path. But is that enough? Can that overcome Ock's true nature? CNN: How did this idea originate? Stephen Wacker: This was an idea Dan had when he came onto the book. It changed shape as we went. It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change. With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang. CNN: Did the word spread around Marvel quickly when this was first discussed? Wacker: Three times a year we have editorial retreats, where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book. Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal. There were certainly some loud opinions in the room. Our editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, was one of the louder voices not buying it originally. All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently. CNN: Was that a sneak preview of how fans might react? Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me. Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online. It gets more magnified with Spidey. You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever. I keep all the fan mail. You can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop Marvel forever. There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction. That's a part of the job I like. Slott: I've actually gotten a fair amount of \\\"This is awesome!\\\" (reactions to the story), but it's been very polarizing. No one has a middling review. No one has a take of, \\\"It was all right.\\\" People are very split. I got an angry tweet saying, \\\"I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people.\\\" I'm like, good luck reading Charles Dickens, Mark Twain -- anything in literature! Now people are saying, \\\"Nooooo! Why are you being mean to (Peter)?\\\" The answer is two words: \\\"Dra. Ma.\\\" CNN: Have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media? Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world! Everyone knows who Spider-Man is-- and everyone cares about him! In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace. But in our world, he's beloved. Now we're going to flip that too. The readers are Jonah. They aren't ready to cut this guy a break. They think he's a menace! This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all! And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Andrew McGaughey, 65, buried to his neck when ground gave way .
