Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power. Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the annual levy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year. Although it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough it into the NHS as quickly as possible. He said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election. Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the Autumn Statement, which have made buying a home worth  1million or more far more expensive. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy   but suggested it may have to be amended following the Chancellor s changes. Labour opponents of the party s own mansion tax scheme have also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position. But the Shadow Chancellor insisted in an interview with the Independent:  Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.  Mr Balls denied charges could be imposed retrospectively.  A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,  he insisted. The Coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls s pledge to raise  2.5billion for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own  3billion boost. Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament. However, Mr Balls said Labour could legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year of 2016-17  as a backstop . Labour s mansion tax will be about  3,000 a year for homes in the  2million to  3million bracket. Experts say an average charge of  11,000 a year will need to be levied to raise the  1.2billion a year Labour predicts. The Conservatives claim it will be extended to cover cheaper properties.\",\n          \"The canine sidekick of a police officer shot to death in the line of duty gave a heart wrenching goodbye to his fallen partner Thursday, standing vigil at the funeral just before the casket was lowered into the ground. It was a deeply emotional funeral for Bardstown, Kentucky police officer Jason Ellis, 33, who was murdered on a highway exit ramp May 25 in what police believe was a planned setup to lure the officer from the safety of his car. His canine partner, Figo, stood beside his casket at Highview Cemetery in Chaplin, Kentucky and a touching photo shows the dog placing a loving paw on Ellis casket, as if giving his last goodbye. Heartbreaking: K9 officer Figo placed a paw on the casket of his fallen partner Jason Ellis Thursday. Ellis, a Bardstown, Kentucky police officer was killed in the line of duty after, police say, he was ambushed on a highway ramp . Targeted: Husband and father of two, Ellis, 33, was a minor league baseball player turned drug enforcement officer. He was killed with multiple gunshot blasts May 25 after what police say was a planned ambush . Figo has been retired and given to Ellis  widow, Amy, and his two sons, ages 6 and 7. Last week, Amy spoke of the agony of sharing the news of his death with her two sons, who idolized their father. 'He wanted to make sure everybody was having a good time around him. He was a dedicated family man. He loved our boys. He loved me,' she said. 'I've laid on the bathroom floor.  I did not want to live another second without him.  I don't have the strength to pray right now, but I know that many others are praying for me and our family. 'Now I know I have to be strong for our kids.' At . Thursday's funeral, Police Chief Rick McCubbin said Ellis  paid the . ultimate sacrifice doing what he loved, being a police officer.  He . called Ellis and Figo  true partners.

Ellis was  gunned down in a senseless act of cowardice and you just want to cry out,  Why?  Snook said at the funeral service. Later, as the funeral procession inched slowly toward the cemetery 18 miles away, young and old stood on the roadside in this town of 12,000 and watched.

The Russian Fencer made 12 passes and flew within 1,000 yards (900 meters) of the USS Donald Cook Navy destroyer on Saturday, U.S. military officials claim. The U.S. warship issued several radio queries and warnings using international emergency circuits but the Russian aircraft, which was flying at about 500 feet (150 meters) above sea level, did not respond. Scroll down for video . Growing tensions: The U.S. military has claimed a Russian fighter jet made multiple close-range passes by one of its navy ships, the USS Donald Cook, in the Black Sea on Saturday . Communications: The USS Destroyer Donald Cook, pictured at the Constanta shipyard in the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta on Monday, attempted to contact the jet but got no response . 'This provocative and unprofessional Russian action is inconsistent with international protocols and previous agreements on the professional interaction between our militaries,' said Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman. The fighter appeared to be unarmed and never was in danger of coming in contact with the ship, said the officials. The passes, which occurred in the early evening there, ended without incident. A second Russian fighter jet flew at a higher altitude and was not a concern, said Warren. A U.S. military official also said that a Russian Navy ship, a frigate, has been shadowing the U.S. warship, remaining within visual distance but not close enough to be unsafe. The official was not authorized to discuss the incident publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. Warren said that he is not aware of any official communication or protests by the U.S. to the Russians about incident. Allegations: A U.S. military official described the action by the fighter jet as 'provocative and unprofessional' Official meetings: Romanian President Traian Basescu, left, boards the USS Donald Cook on Monday . The USS Donald Cook has been conducting routine operations in international waters east of Romania. The ship, which carries helicopters, was deployed to the Black Sea on April 10, in the wake of the Russian military takeover of Ukraine's Crimea region and ongoing unrest there. U.S. military officials have said the deployment is part of an effort to reassure allies and partners in the region. Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov on Monday called for the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping troops in the east of the country, where pro-Russian insurgents have occupied buildings in nearly 10 cities. The gunmen are demanding more autonomy from the central government and closer ties with Russia. The West has accused Moscow of fomenting the unrest. And European Union foreign ministers are meeting in Luxembourg Monday to consider additional sanctions against Russian officials because of Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The USS Donald Cook warship was deployed to the Black Sea in the wake of Russia's annexing of Crimea . Armed: Two U.S. Navy technical staff check a two barrel gun on board of the USS Donald Cook warship . The USS Donald Cook is now in port at Constanta, Romania. Romanian President Traian Basescu visited the ship Monday and said a second U.S. Navy warship - a frigate from the Navy's Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea - is also heading to the Black Sea. 'My visit to the ship is symbolic, which first of all shows our respect to our NATO allies' reaction who have strengthened their presence in the Black Sea after Russia's annexation of Crimea,' said Basescu, who is a former ship captain. He said the Russians 'had created a circle of fire around the Black Sea.' The U.S. frigate, which has not yet been identified, is expected to arrive in the Black Sea in the next two weeks. According to a U.S. military official, the frigate is likely to replace the USS Donald Cook, which is expected to return to the Mediterranean Sea.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 500,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"It is unusual for tax to be introduced in the course of the financial year .
